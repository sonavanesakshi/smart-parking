# smart-parking
local web app that simplifies parking management by enabling users to register, manage vehicles, and book slots through an interactive platform powered by MySQL and frontend web technologies.

This project is a Smart Parking system developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. The application is built as a web-based platform and runs locally using XAMPP. It provides users with the ability to register, log in, add or remove vehicles, and book or cancel parking slots through an interactive interface.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for creating the user interface
Backend: PHP (optional) – for handling form submissions and database interaction
Database: MySQL – for storing user data, vehicle details, and parking slot information
Server Environment: XAMPP – used to run Apache and MySQL locally

Working

Users first register and then log in to access the system.
Once logged in, they can add vehicle details (2-wheeler or 4-wheeler) and view available parking slots.
Users can book a slot based on area-wise availability and also cancel existing bookings.
The system dynamically updates the slot availability and allows users to search parking locations using location filters.
All user actions are stored and retrieved from the MySQL database to ensure persistence.
The system aims to automate the manual parking process, reduce the time spent searching for available parking, and offer a simple, reliable solution for both users and parking space managers.
